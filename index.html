    <h2>Obsessed with Flight</h2>
    <p>From birds wings to rocket propulsion, the ability to soar through the air is the end all be all of abilities. The entity that can do this most graciously and effortlessly will find itself with a great advantage in both terms of impressiveness and logistical superiority. It has been my goal to reach the razor's edge of industry, technology, and theory in all aspects associated with flight. I intend to advance this field as far as possible in my lifetime. </p>

    <h2>Mystified by Machine Intelligence</h2>
    <p>In what stretch of code does a machine gain the ability to learn? If a machine becomes self aware, should we destroy it, or nurture it? Answers to these questions are far more pragmatic than surface level consideration would suggest and indeed either could be considered a spiritual dilemma. If you are reading this then the ability to experiment with this technology is literally at your fingertips. Too tantalizing for me to ignore, I have begun my own investigation into machine intelligence by building a functioning quadrupedal robot.</p>

    <h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
    <p>My name is Kenneth Mikolaichik, a Texas native born 1990. I grew up in Austin the youngest of three and only boy, son of a chemist and a seamstress. I developed a knack for repairing every day things at a young age. Ever hungry for more knowledge and spurred on by a desire to live comfortably, I attended the Liberal Arts and Science Academy High School in Austin. During that time and shortly after several immediate members of my family passed away, these are my lost years. Afterwards I attended ITT tech in pursuit of an electrical engineering degree. Those commercials really got me. After I came to my senses and while still attending, I joined the US Navy and received training as an aircraft mechanic in Pensacola Florida, where I was top of my class and class leader. I received an award and was promoted immediately to E-4. Within two years of my enlistment date I was again promoted to E-5 wherein I became the second shift supervisor of 10 F-18 Superhornets for the airframes shop of VFA-151. Upon exiting my military contact I resided in California for 2 years restoring F-18’s that had not flown in years, a rewarding job. It was around this time that I completed an associates in aeronautics from Embry Riddle. Missing my family, and longing for those Texas sunsets and the sounds of mourning doves and cicadas, I moved back to Texas, this time San Antonio. I worked for Northrop Grumman for a year or two and then decided that simply wasn’t enough. I needed to contribute to something more. This was when I decided to pursue a physics degree at the University of Texas and seriously investigate new approaches to lift. </p>
